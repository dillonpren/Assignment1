e) Branches allow experimental features and bug fixes to be tried without
   comprimising the main branch. Also multiple branches allow multiple
   of these features to be tested out at the same time.

i) Iheritance is an "is-a" relationship in which one class inherits properties
   from a "parent" class. Ex: A Dog class may inherit from an Animal class.
   
   Polymorhpism is a feature in which a pointer of a "parent" class type
   in an inheritance relationship may be used to point to an object in a 
   child class.

   Encapsulation is keeping data together with the functions that interact with
   them such as a get() and set() function for a private variable in a class.
